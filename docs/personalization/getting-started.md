## Getting started with personalization

Before jumping into personalization, have answers to these questions ready first.

-   What audience are you trying to target?
-   How large is the audience?
    -   Reference the [Go/No go estimator][gonogoestimator]
        to calculate and determine the viability of your project.
-   What do you want that audience to do?
-   What would success look like for this audience?
-   What type of experience(s) do you want to use?
-   Are any tests or personalizations already running on the page you
    are working on?
