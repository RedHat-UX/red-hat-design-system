## Overview

The Active tab is a simple experience applicable to any page that contains
tabs. It aims to customize the visitor experience by highlighting a tab based
on the interests of a user.

## Design

Active tab uses the existing tab component design and only customizes the
active tab within the tab set (no custom design work is needed).
