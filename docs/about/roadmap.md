Our roadmap is an up-to-date outline of what we're working on and what we're planning to do in the Red Hat Design System over the next 2â€“3 quarters (6-9 months). You can follow along through [our open source roadmap on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/RedHat-UX/projects/7/).

The roadmap is subject to change based on our users' feedback and needs. If you have an idea or feature request, please submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/RedHat-UX/red-hat-design-system/issues).

Check out [our scrum board on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/RedHat-UX/projects/1/views/18) to see what we're working on from week to week.
