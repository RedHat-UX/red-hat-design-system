  <p>We use several Adobe XD libraries to serve the consumers of the <strong>Red Hat Digital Design System</strong> and other web tools. Depending on your needs, you may request an invite to access one or more of our libraries. Each library is updated regularly so rest assured you will always be working with the latest colors, character styles, components, and more. To learn how to use libraries, watch the following video.</p>

{% call getstarted.section("Adobe XD") -%}

  <p>All of our libraries are maintained in <strong>Adobe XD</strong> and <strong>Adobe Creative Cloud</strong>. They need to be installed so you can use features like <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/prototype/component-states/component-states-common-use-cases.html" target="_blank">Component States</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/prototype.html" target="_blank">Prototyping</a>. Once a license is granted, Associates can install their desired app(s) from within Adobe Creative Cloud. Contact your manager for further assistance if necessary.</p>

{% call getstarted.section("Library vs. kit") -%}

    <p>A library is how XD manages and distributes colors, character styles, and components that were created in XD or imported from another design program. The term <strong>library</strong> is generic because it can include anything whereas the term <strong>kit</strong> is more specific like a kit of parts built for a single use case, for example the <a href="../get-started/design-system-kit">Design system kit</a>. A kit is also a library, but we use the term kit to identify a specific collection of elements used for one purpose only.<p>
