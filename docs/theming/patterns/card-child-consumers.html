    The card <em>and</em> CTA respond to the theme of their container.
    On a light container, the CTA uses the light theme, and dark on dark.

<rh-card color-palette="darkest">
  <p>
    The card uses the "darkest" palette.
    The CTA is always themed with the "dark" theme, because the card
    sets its own palette, rather than responding to it's container's.
