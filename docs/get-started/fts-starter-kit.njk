  <p>The <em>Flexible Template System</em> (FTS) is a pattern building system in Drupal that allows its users to scale redhat.com web properties. It serves as a powerful development tool and a comprehensive library of our patterns. FTS users can customize patterns in <em>Patternkit</em> and then use those same patterns to build pages and experiences in Drupal. FTS is a powerful system that empowers its users to build web experiences that are aligned to our brand standards and design system.</p>

  <p>Red Hat uses <em>Drupal</em>, the content management system. Over 30,000 pages are maintained in Drupal including support for eight languages. As our redhat.com web properties scale, it is vital to have a powerful content management system that designers and developers can use to build or update pages quickly. A one-time three-hour training session is offered to all new Drupal users; you are automatically enrolled in this session when you are granted Drupal access.</p>

{% call getstarted.section("FTS starter kit") -%}

  <p>The <em>FTS starter kit</em> acts as a bridge between XD and the page building experience in Drupal. Sometimes designers are unsure of what FTS patterns are available, or they want to do their best to maintain consistency, when moving from a design to development environment. The FTS starter kit aims to eliminate these inconsistencies by providing designers with customizable FTS patterns that are 1:1 when using the same patterns to build pages and experiences in Drupal.</p>

  <h4>Using patterns</h4>

  <p>To use FTS patterns in XD, find your desired pattern in the <em>Libraries</em> panel and add it to your design by dragging and dropping. To replace a pattern, switch to the <em>Layers</em> panel by pressing <strong>Command+Y</strong> (or <strong>Control+Y</strong> on Windows). Select the pattern (the layer with a chain icon on the left), switch back to the Libraries panel, and drag and drop a new pattern on top of it. To reset a pattern, right-click on the pattern and select <em>Reset to Main State</em>.</p>

    <img src="{{ '/assets/get-started/fts-starter-kit/using-patterns.png' | url }}" alt="Using FTS starter kit patterns" style="--example-img-max-width: 872px;">
  {%- endcall %}

  <h4>Component states</h4>

  <p>Every FTS pattern includes <em>Component States</em> which are states you can toggle to display various specs or design options. Toggling component states is a good way to learn about FTS patterns and how to customize them in Drupal. Each FTS pattern includes the following component states.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Default State</strong> - Resets a pattern to the default appearance</li>
    <li><strong>Blueprint</strong> - Overlays element labels which correspond to fields or inputs in Patternkit and Drupal</li>
    <li><strong>Layout options</strong> - Displays some examples of possible layout configurations</li>
    <li><strong>Alignment</strong> - Displays alignment options for elements like calls to action or text</li>
    <li><strong>Spacers</strong> - Shows how elements should use <a href="../../foundations/spacing">spacers</a> according to the design system</li>
    <li><strong>Themes</strong> - Shows how the appearance of elements change depending on what theme is selected</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern builder demo link</strong> - Overlays a link to customize the pattern using Patternkit</li>
  </ul>

  {%- endcall %}

  <h4>Element labeling</h4>

  <p>In the <em>Blueprint</em> component state, every element is labeled. When you want to customize an element in Patternkit or Drupal, look for the input or field that matches the element label.</p>

  {% call getstarted.example(palette='lightest') %}
    <img src="{{ '/assets/get-started/fts-starter-kit/element-labeling.png' | url }}" alt="Labeling FTS starter kit elements" style="--example-img-max-width: 872px;">
  {%- endcall %}

{%- endcall %}

{% call getstarted.section("Working in Drupal") -%}

  <h4>Pattern options</h4>

  <p>The patterns available in the FTS starter kit are about the same as the ones in Patternkit and Drupal which makes it easy to recreate your page design when building.</p>

  {% call getstarted.example(palette='lightest') %}
    <img src="{{ '/assets/get-started/fts-starter-kit/pattern-options.png' | url }}" alt="FTS starter kit pattern options" style="--example-img-max-width: 872px;">
  {%- endcall %}

  <h4>Adding and customizing patterns</h4>

  <p>When you want to add a new FTS pattern in Drupal, reference the element labels in the <em>Blueprint</em> component state to know exactly which inputs and fields are available to customize.<br /><br />FTS patterns can be customized with just a few clicks. To change something, expand a dropdown to see what customizations are available. To add or remove a component like a call to action, there are buttons nearby. This continuous loop of working with FTS patterns in XD and then building them in Drupal takes practice, but it can reduce working time a lot once you get the process right.</p>

{% call getstarted.section("Best practices") -%}

  <p>When creating the FTS starter kit library and leveraging Drupal, our goal is to give users tools to empower them to design and develop on-brand and on-system websites and experiences by themselves. There are lots of ways to customize FTS patterns in XD or Patternkit and then build them in Drupal. However, there are also lots of ways to stray off-brand and off-system. When working with the assets in this library, the following resources should help you stay aligned.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Design system <a href="../../foundations/">foundations</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/brand/standards">Brand standards</a> like icons, illustrations, photography, etc.</li>
    <li>FTS <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/demo-fts-patterns">patterns</a> or <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/demo-fts-layouts">layout</a> demo pages so you can see what exists already</li>
    <li><a href="https://red.ht/3zw5qKy">The Source</a> page</li>
  </ul>

  <img src="{{ '/assets/get-started/fts-starter-kit/best-practices.png' | url }}" alt="FTS starter kit best practices" style="--example-img-max-width: 1000px;">

{% call getstarted.section("Frequently asked questions") -%}

  <p><strong>How does a pattern in Drupal get added or updated?</strong>
  <br />
  The design system team meets regularly with the FTS team to discuss new pattern requests or updates, which are assigned a priority in <a href="https://redhat.my.workfront.com/project/633c6cef0024d5153347a624f1351b0a/tasks">Workfront</a> as they come in. Once a priority is set and a schedule is agreed upon, design or development work begins. When the work is complete, the FTS starter kit library and the WebRH repo are updated. All updates are then communicated to the team via a monthly e-mail newsletter.</p>
