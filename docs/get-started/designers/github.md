## Getting familiar with GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/RedHat-UX/red-hat-design-system) is how we maintain our 
design system. It is the repo for all of our components, design tokens, and icons. 
We also use it to plan releases, track progress, update the documentation website, 
and much more.

## Contributing

Here are some ways for designers to contribute to the design system.

  - **Easy** - create a [discussion](https://github.com/RedHat-UX/red-hat-design-system/discussions) and include as much information as possible, we will take care of the rest
  - **Advanced** - create an issue using a template and you will be assigned to review our work in a [pull request](https://github.com/RedHat-UX/red-hat-design-system/pulls) when the time comes

## Roadmap

Go to the [Roadmap](/about/roadmap/) page to see our current and future release 
schedule.

If you need something designed or coded sooner rather than later, here are some 
options. When we receive your request, we will discuss as a team and get back to you.

  - Create a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/RedHat-UX/red-hat-design-system/discussions) (fastest)
  - Connect with us on [Slack](/support/#contact-us)
  - [Email us](mailto:design-system@redhat.com) (slowest)
