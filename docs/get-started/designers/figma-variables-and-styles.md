## Introduction

### Philosophy

Using Figma variables and styles is an evolution from **painting pictures** to **building systems**. It reframes design as a shared language between disciplines, where we communicate with design tokens that carry intent, not just appearance.

This philosophical shift redefines our role as designers from creators of static visuals to architects of dynamic coherent language that **bridges design and engineering**.

## Benefits

Figma variables and styles have established new best practices around how design systems should be structured and managed. These best practices result in the following benefits and impacts.

## Terminology

### What are design tokens?

Design tokens are the **single source of truth** that represent the small repeatable design choices that construct our visual language. A token is a concept, a named decision, whereas a Figma variable is its direct raw implementation and a Figma style is a bundle of tokens applied to a specific property.

To learn more, go to the [Tokens](/tokens/) section.

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt="Screenshot of how a raw value goes from a primative token to a semantic token and is then used in various components."
       src="figma-vars-terminology-1.svg"
       width="945"
       height="183"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

### What are Figma variables

Figma variables are reusable values that can be applied to various design properties. Instead of manually changing individual elements, we can update a variable and every element linked to it will automatically change. This is useful for managing design tokens, maintaining consistency, creating different themes, and more.

The following variable types are included in the RHDS library.

<div class="grid gapless xs-two-columns">
  <div class="col">
    <ul>
      <li>Border</li>
      <li>Breakpoint</li>
      <li>Icon</li>
      <li>Opacity</li>
      <li>Typography</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="col">
    <ul>
      <li>Box shadow</li>
      <li>Color</li>
      <li>Length</li>
      <li>Space</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt="Illustration showing how a primative or crayon variable transforms to a semantic variable then a semantic variable goes on to be applied as a fill property in Figma."
       src="figma-vars-terminology-2.svg"
       width="1012"
       height="229"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

### What are Figma styles?

Figma styles are reusable bundles of tokens created for specific properties. Think of them as a shortcut for applying a consistent look to components. When we update a style, every object using that style will update across your files, ensuring visual consistency.

The following style types are included in the RHDS library.

  - Colors (like gradients)
  - Text (bundled tokens like font family, line height, size, weight, and more)
  - Effects (like drop shadows)
  - Layout grids

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt="Two figma panes showing a set of variables that make up a text and drop shadow style"
       src="figma-vars-terminology-3.svg"
       width="608"
       height="429"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

## Using variables and styles

The introduction and evolution of Figma variables and styles represent a significant shift.

### New ways of working

Figma variables and styles usher in a new era of **systems thinking**. Instead of thinking in terms of individual screens, we are now encouraged to think in terms of a structured hierarchical system of design tokens.

Here are some key workflow shifts for designers:

  - Abstracting decisions with tokens
  - Designing for themes and modes
  - A deeper connection to code and development

### Theming 

Figma variables and styles create a powerful and efficient system for [theming](/theming/). This capability allows teams to manage multiple design language modes from a single unified source of truth.

The power of theming extends far beyond color schemes. Here are other ways we might leverage modes for advanced theming in the future:

  - Accessibility
  - Multi-brand systems
  - Spacing and density
  - Platform- or product-specific


<uxdot-example variant="full" no-border color-palette="lightest">
  <img alt="Two alerts, one light scheme, one dark scheme side by side."
       src="figma-vars-theming.svg"
       width="1140"
       height="299"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

### Finding and applying

<rh-alert state="info">
  <h4 slot="header">Helpful tip</h4>
  <p>All RHDS components and patterns are preloaded with variables and styles that map to our design tokens.</p>
</rh-alert>

#### Fill 

To apply a Fill variable, when an element is selected, select the four dots icon next to the Fill title. From here, browse the list of fill variables or search for something specific.

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt="Showing a selected rectangle in figma and the process to display the fill panel and select a new fill from a token or variable"
       src="figma-vars-finding-applying-1.svg"
       width="1004"
       height="468"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

#### Type

To change a type style, select the current type style under the Typography title. From here, browse the list of type styles or search for something specific.

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt="Selected type in figma with the user selecting the type property panel and browsing different typographic styles, eventually searching for a specific style."
       src="figma-vars-finding-applying-2.svg"
       width="940"
       height="421"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

#### Drop shadow

Adding or changing a drop shadow style is about the same process as a type style.

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt="User selecting an rh-alert in Figma, going to the effects panel, and browsing all drop shadows."
       src="figma-vars-finding-applying-3.svg"
       width="960"
       height="269"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

### Switching between color schemes

Figma variables are organized using **modes** to enable switching between light and dark schemes. The default color scheme is Light scheme.

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt="Showing the panes in figma that allow users to change from a light scheme to a dark color scheme in the appearance panel."
       src="figma-vars-switching-schemes-1.svg"
       width="747"
       height="183"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

To switch color schemes, select the menu in the Appearance panel and choose another scheme. To reset to default, select the â€” (minus) icon next to the dropdown.

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt=""
       src="figma-vars-switching-schemes-2.svg"
       width="576"
       height="148"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

### Help text

Every variable and style has **help text** included. Just hover to see it. If any help text is confusing or needs edits, [contact us](/support/#documentation-and-figma-help).

<uxdot-example no-border color-palette="lighter">
  <img alt="Two figma panes showing a cursor hovering over a tooltip with help text."
       src="figma-vars-help-text.svg"
       width="546"
       height="312"
       loading="lazy">
</uxdot-example>

## Best practices

### Detaching

Do not detach variables or styles, this is the most common way to introduce inconsistencies. Check the library first and if you still think you need something new or edited, [contact us](/support/#documentation-and-figma-help).

<div class="grid sm-two-columns">
  <uxdot-best-practice variant="do">
    <uxdot-example slot="image" color-palette="lightest">
      <img src="figma-vars-best-practice-1-do.svg"
        alt="A selected CTA in figma showing the selection colors displayed as RHDS tokens"
        width="482"
        height="270">
    </uxdot-example>
    <p>Maintain the variables and styles that have already been applied.</p>
  </uxdot-best-practice>

  <uxdot-best-practice variant="dont">
    <uxdot-example slot="image" color-palette="lightest">
      <img src="figma-vars-best-practice-1-dont.svg"
        alt="A selecetd CTA in figma showing the selection colors as hex values"
        width="482"
        height="270">
    </uxdot-example>
    <p>Do not detach any variables or styles.</p>
  </uxdot-best-practice>
</div>

### Primitive variables

Do not use primitive variables because they break the connection to theming and semantic meaning.

<div class="grid sm-two-columns">
  <uxdot-best-practice variant="do">
    <uxdot-example slot="image" color-palette="lightest">
      <img src="figma-vars-best-practice-2-do.svg"
        alt="A figma dialog showing the rh-color-interactive-primary-default token"
        width="482"
        height="152">
    </uxdot-example>
    <p>Use token or Figma-only semantic variables as much as possible.</p>
  </uxdot-best-practice>

  <uxdot-best-practice variant="dont">
    <uxdot-example slot="image" color-palette="lightest">
      <img src="figma-vars-best-practice-2-dont.svg"
        alt="A figma dialog showing the rh-color-blue-50 token"
        width="482"
        height="152">
    </uxdot-example>
    <p>Do not use primitive variables unless absolutely necessary.</p>
  </uxdot-best-practice>
</div>
