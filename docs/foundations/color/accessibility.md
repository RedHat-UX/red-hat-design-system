## Approach

At our core, we believe in creating interactions and experiences that are 
inclusive. This means ensuring that all Red Hat digital properties are 
accessible to everyone.

## Using color alone

When considering methods of communication or feedback, do not use color or 
location alone. Ensure there is text, an icon, an underline, or other visual 
cue to communicate meaning. Consider how these elements look to a 
color blind user.

## Color contrast

### Body and code text

Foreground body and code text (non-bold text **under 24px** and bold text 
**under 19px**) must have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1. Large foreground body and 
code text (non-bold text of **at least 24px** and bold text of **at least 
19px**) must have a contrast ratio of 3:1.

  <img alt="Two examples of dark text on light backgrounds and two examples of light text on dark backgrounds."

</uxdot-example>

### Red text on backgrounds

Our primary brand color is known as Red Hat red (`#E00`). It has many 
applications, but on the web, it does not pass color contrast against all 
background colors, especially text at small sizes. 

If red text cannot be used, use dark gray or black text against lighter 
backgrounds, or light gray or white text against darker backgrounds. If you have 
questions about using other red colors, contact the [Brand team][standards].

<rh-alert state="warning">
  <h4 slot="header">Warning</h4>
  Black is usually a brand-only color, but it can be used very sparingly for backgrounds only if <code>gray-95</code> cannot be used.

#### WCAG requirements

WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text 
and 3:1 for large text. WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for 
graphics and UI components like form input borders. Use the table below to 
confirm you are using color contrast correctly before using red text. 

The font sizes that are considered normal and large are as follows:
- normal: non-bold text under 18pt/24px and bold text under 14pt/19px
- large: non-bold text of at least 18pt/24px and bold text of at least 14pt/19px

| Background color      | Contrast ratio | Normal text           | Large text            | Objects and UI components |

### Links

To differentiate text links from their surrounding text without relying on color 
contrast, links in all states must be underlined. Links isolated within visually 
distinct sections (e.g., navigation menus) or with additional visual cues (e.g., 
CTA arrows) are exempt from this requirement, though you may still add 
underlines at your discretion.

  <img alt="Contrast ratio of a blue link next to black text and an example of a link's darker blue, underlined hover state" src="/assets/color/color-a11y-contrast-links.png">
</uxdot-example>

### Graphical objects and UI components

Graphical objects and UI components like charts and infographics should have a 
contrast ratio of at least 3:1. If color is the only way to distinguish between 
inline controls and surrounding text, the contrast ratio between the control and 
text must be at least 3:1.

- Non-color cues like borders must be used to signify when an element receives 
  focus

### Layering

You can layer colors on light or dark backgrounds. However, layering colors near 
or on top of other colors will cause vibration. For more information about 
layering colors, follow [WCAG 2.1 
AA][wcag21aa] requirements.
