## Approach

At our core, we believe in creating interactions and experiences that are 
inclusive. This means ensuring that all Red Hat digital properties are 
accessible to everyone.

## Using color alone

When considering methods of communication or feedback, do not use color (or 
location) alone. Ensure there is a text label, icon, underline, or other visual 
cue to communicate meaning. Consider how the following elements would look to a 
color blind user.

{% example palette="light",
          alt="Dialog with a red-orange Leave button, a form field with a red bottom border, and progress steps without labels",
          src="/assets/color/using-color-alone.png" %}

## Contrast

We strive to adhere to [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/) requirements. Our text, links, 
interface elements, etc. are designed with sufficient contrast when used on top 
of a canvas, surfaces, image backgrounds with low contrast, and near adjacent 
colors.

### Text

Small foreground text (non-bold text under 24px and bold text under 19px) must 
have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 and large foreground text (non-bold text of at 
least 24px and bold text of at least 19px) must have a contrast ratio of 3:1.

{% example palette="light",
          alt="Contrast ratios for dark gray sections with black text that uses different weights and fonts",
          src="/assets/color/contrast-text.png" %}

### Links

If color is the only way to distinguish between links and surrounding text (for 
example, if link underlines are removed), the contrast ratio between the link 
and surrounding text must be at least 3:1.

- Non-color cues must be used to signify when the link receives hover or focus (for example, an underline)

{% example palette="light",
          alt="Contrast ratio of a blue link next to black text and an example of a link's darker blue, underlined hover state",
          src="/assets/color/contrast-links.png" %}

### Graphical objects and UI components

Graphical objects and UI components should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 
(for example, within charts and infographics). If color is the only way to 
distinguish between inline controls and their surrounding text, the contrast 
ratio between the control and text must be at least 3:1.

- Non-color cues (for example, a border) must be used to signify when the element receives focus

### Layering

It is acceptable to layer colors with the same hue, saturation, or lightness on 
white, black, or gray. However, layering them near or on top of each other might 
cause vibration. If you need to layer colors, follow [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/) 
requirements.

{% example palette="light",
          alt="Red CTA against a white background, blue button against a light gray background, and a light red-orange button against a black background",
          src="/assets/color/contrast-layering.png",
          caption="TEST" %}

### Tools

TPGiâ€™s [Colour Contrast Analyzer](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/) can help you identify colors and 
gauge their contrast from one another.
