<h2 class="large-red-text">The fonts we use affects the way our audience perceives our brand just as much as the words that we write.</h2>

To make our words unmistakably Red Hat, we use the Red Hat® font family—with straightforward and approachable typography.

## Fonts and typography

How we apply our fonts, also known as typography, can be just as impactful as the design of the fonts themselves. We write the way that real people talk, so we use our fonts in a way that reflects that. The basics of typography at Red Hat align to our brand personality traits.
