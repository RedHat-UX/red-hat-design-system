## Get started

To download the font files, go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?query=MCKL). To install the fonts using Terminal, go to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont). If you need further assistance, contact the [Brand team](https://brand.redhat.com/) or the [Design System team](https://ux.redhat.com/support/).

## Font family

The words we choose are an important part of our brand voice and so is the way those words look. The way our words look is established by the fonts we use and the way we use them, also known as typography. The Red Hat font family was designed by type designer Jeremy Mickel in collaboration with the Brand team. To learn more our fonts and typography, go to the [Brand standards](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/brand/standards) website.

### Red Hat Display

Red Hat Display is used in headlines and to make big statements. Because Red Hat Display is intended for large sizes, it has more of our brand personality and voice.

### Red Hat Text

Red Hat Text takes all of the personality from Red Hat Display and optimizes it for more demanding applications. It is easy to read in paragraphs and very small sizes.

### Red Hat Mono

Red Hat Mono is our monospaced font that was created to distinguish code from other text. It should only be used when demonstrating code snippets in our communications and specifications.

## International

Designs that need to use non-Latin characters should fall back to [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans). By loading language-specific fonts, the design system can accommodate mixed-language content. For more technical details, go to the [Tokens](https://ux.redhat.com/tokens/font/) section.
