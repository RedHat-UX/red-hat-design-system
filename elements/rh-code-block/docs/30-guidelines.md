## Usage
Use a code block to highlight code text only, no other styles should be 
included.

### When to use a code block

If a block of code text needs to be highlighted separate from paragraphs or 
other elements, use a code block.

## Sizes

A code block container can adhere to the width of content within or be fixed 
width.

<uxdot-example width-adjustment="872px">
  <img src="../code-block-sizes.png" alt="Image of fluid width and fixed width code block sizes with text labels below">
</uxdot-example>

## Content

The length of code text and the number of lines can change the width and height 
of a code block.

<uxdot-example width-adjustment="872px">
  <img src="../code-block-content.png" alt="Image of two code blocks; one code block is fluid width showing only one line and the other code block is fixed width showing 10 lines">
</uxdot-example>


## Responsive design

### Large breakpoints

<uxdot-example width-adjustment="1000px" variant="full" no-border alignment="left">
  <img src="../code-block-breakpoints-large.png" alt="Image of code blocks on desktop and tablet breakpoints">
</uxdot-example>

### Small breakpoints

Container spacing and code text size reduces as breakpoints get smaller.

<uxdot-example width-adjustment="576px" variant="full" no-border alignment="left">
  <img src="../code-block-breakpoints-small.png" alt="Image of code blocks on large and small mobile breakpoints">
</uxdot-example>


## Best practices

### Different font

Do not use a different font than `--rh-font-family-code`.
