## Keyboard interactions
A tooltip will appear when the trigger receives focus and disappear when moving focus away from the trigger.

{% example palette="light",
          alt="Tooltip keyboard interactions; pressing tab to focus the trigger will show the tooltip, but pressing tab again will hide the tooltip",
          src="../tooltip-keyboard-interactions.png" %}{% endexample %}

| Key {style="width: 50%" } | Result                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>            | Moves focus to the trigger, tooltip appear                   |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>            | Moves focus away from the trigger, tooltip disappears        |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd>            | Removes a tooltip without moving focus away from the trigger |

## Additional guidelines
 - Do not use a tooltip on static elements
 - A tooltip should persist while hovering over the trigger and tooltip
 - A tooltip should persist as long as the trigger has focus
 - Users navigating via screen reader must have tooltip text announced to them when it is triggered
 - If a tooltip is added to a disabled trigger, that trigger must be able to receive focus
