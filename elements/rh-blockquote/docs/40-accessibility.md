## Implementation

- To provide context, include an <code>aria-label</code> attribute in the markup
- Ensure the blockquote is not interactive and cannot receive focus (unless there are interactive elements)
- Ensure that surrounding content can convey the purpose of a blockquote via assistive technologies
- Using a blockquote for anything other than its intended purpose will be confusing for assistive technologies
