## Chip and Chip Group

This component consists of two components: `<rh-chip>` and, optionally, `<rh-chip-group>`.

Chip creates a component that can be used in place of a checkbox.

A [Chip Group](/elements/chip/demos/#demo-chip-group) is a wrapper component that adds an accessible label for the group and a "clear all" button.

## When to use

- Allow users to select from a list of options
- Indicate to users what selections they made
- Represent a checkbox group with more emphasis
