## When to use

- Allow users to select from a list of options
- Indicate to users what selections they made
- Represent a checkbox group with more emphasis

## Chip groups

When working with multiple related chips, use a [chip group](/elements/chip/demos/#demo-chip-group). 

Chip groups are used to present multiple selectable options that users can toggle on or off, such as filters or preference settings. The chip group element:

- Groups chips together
- Provides an accessible label for the set
- Includes a “clear all” button to reset all selections at once
