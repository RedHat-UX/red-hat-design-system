# Chip

Chip creates a component that can be used in place of a checkbox.

## Usage

Individual `<rh-chip>`'s are wrapped by an `<rh-chip-group>` element.

```html
<rh-chip-group>
  <rh-chip>Edge</rh-chip>
  <rh-chip>AI/ML</rh-chip>
  <rh-chip>DevOps</rh-chip>
</rh-chip-group>
```

See the [official documentation](https://ux.redhat.com/elements/chip/code/) for more customization options.
