# Button Group
The Button Group component groups related buttons together so that users understand they belong to the same action set. It helps organize UI controls and improves accessibility by signaling a relationship between actions.

## Usage
Use a Button Group when multiple buttons perform related tasks, such as navigation, form actions, or filter options. Keep groups concise for clarity and consistency.

```html
<rh-button-group>
  <rh-button>Save</rh-button>
  <rh-button>Cancel</rh-button>
  <rh-button>Delete</rh-button>
</rh-button-group>
```
