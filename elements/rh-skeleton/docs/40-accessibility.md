## Implementation

  * By default, `<rh-skeleton>` places visually hidden text, "Loading...", into the default slot of this component. This informs users of assistive technologies that content is loading.
  * To customize this text, slot in alternate content. You may want to do this if you want to differentiate between multiple skeletons on a page.
