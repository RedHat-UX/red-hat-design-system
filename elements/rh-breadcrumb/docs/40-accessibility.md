## Keyboard navigation

Users should have the ability to move focus to a breadcrumb and activate a breadcrumb link using their keyboard.

<rh-table>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" data-label="Key">Key</th>
        <th scope="col" data-label="Result">Result</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td data-label="Key">Tab</td>
        <td data-label="Result">Moves focus to the next linked breadcrumb or interactive element</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td data-label="Key">Shift + Tab</td>
        <td data-label="Result">Moves focus to the previous linked breadcrumb or interactive element</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td data-label="Result">Activates a link</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</rh-table>

## Focus order

A logical focus order helps keyboard users operate our websites. Elements need to receive focus in an order that preserves meaning, therefore the focus order should make sense and not jump around randomly. In breadcrumb navigation, the focus order moves from left to right.
