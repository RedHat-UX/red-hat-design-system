## Style 
A timestamp is a simple line of text that displays date and time values.

### Anatomy 
{% example palette="light",
          alt="Anatomy of a timestamp which is a simple line of text showing the date first and then the time after",
          src="../timestamp-anatomy.png" %}

1. Date
2. Time
{.example-notes}

## Size 
The size of a timestamp is determined by the text size it is applied to.

{% example palette="light",
          alt="Two lines of text of various sizes with timestamps applied, one is 18px and the other is 24px",
          src="../timestamp-size.png" %}

## Tooltip
Two lines of text with timestamps applied, one is showing no styling and the other is showing a dashed underline.

{% example palette="light",
          alt="Light theme badges",
          src="../timestamp-style-tooltip.png" %}

## Theme
A timestamp can be used in the same themes as text.

### Light theme
<div class="example example--palette-lightest component">
    <rh-timestamp></rh-timestamp>
</div>


### Dark theme
<div class="example example--palette-darkest component">
    <rh-timestamp></rh-timestamp>
</div>

## Interaction states 
If a timestamp is linked, the interaction states are the same as a [link](https://ux.redhat.com/patterns/link/). Go to the Link page to see the interaction states.
