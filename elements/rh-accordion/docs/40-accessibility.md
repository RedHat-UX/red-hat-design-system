## Keyboard interactions
Each panel is a focus stop where `Enter` or `Space` expands or collapses each panel.

{% example palette="light",
          alt="",
          src="./accordion-keyboard-interactions.pngAccordion keyboard interactions; pressing Tab will focus the top panel, pressing Tab again will move focus to the next panel underneath, and pressing Enter or Space will expand the panel" %}

| Key | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | Moves focus to the next panel |
| Shift+Tab | Moves focus to the previous panel |
| Enter/Space | Expands or collapses a panel |
