## Implementation
- To provide context, include an <code>aria-label</code> attribute in the markup
- Ensure the badge is not interactive and cannot have focus
- Ensure badge information is not conveyed by color alone like a read or unread badge
- Ensure that surrounding content can

{% include 'accessibility/ariaguide.md' %}
{% include 'accessibility/wcag.md' %}
