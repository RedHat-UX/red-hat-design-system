## Keyboard interactions

Users should have the ability to move focus to a video embed element and play the video using the keyboard.

<uxdot-example width-adjustment="424px">
  <img src="../video-keyboard-navigation.svg"
        alt="Screenshots of a video embed showing a darkened play button on focus"
        width="428"
        height="284">
</uxdot-example>

<rh-table>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" data-label="Key">Key</th>
        <th scope="col" data-label="Result">Result</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td data-label="Key"><kbd>Tab</kbd></td>
          <td data-label="Result">Moves focus to video</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td data-label="Key"><kbd>Enter</kbd></td>
          <td data-label="Result">Plays the video</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</rh-table>

## Additional guidelines

  * The iframe element should use the video title in its title attribute
  * The play button text should use the video title, followed by the type of video in parentheses, i.e. "(YouTube video)"
  * The thumbnail image should have alt text that describes the image, followed by "(video thumbnail)"
  * The YouTube embed should have accurate captions. Autogenerated captions by YouTube are not sufficient
  * Read more on [audio/video accessibility](/accessibility/content/#audio%2Fvideo)
