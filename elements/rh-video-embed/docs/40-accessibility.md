## Keyboard interactions

Users should have the ability to move focus to a video embed element and play the video using the keyboard.

<uxdot-example width-adjustment="424px">
  <img alt="Screenshots of a video embed showing a darkened play button on focus"
       src="../video-keyboard-navigation.svg"
       width="428"
       height="284">
</uxdot-example>

<rh-table>

| Key              | Result               |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>   | Moves focus to video |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Plays the video      |

</rh-table>

## Additional guidelines

  * The iframe element should use the video title in its title attribute
  * The play button text should use the video title, followed by the type of video in parentheses, i.e. "(YouTube video)"
  * The thumbnail image should have alt text that describes the image, followed by "(video thumbnail)"
  * The YouTube embed should have accurate captions. Autogenerated captions by YouTube are not sufficient
  * Read more on [audio/video accessibility](/accessibility/content/#audio%2Fvideo)
