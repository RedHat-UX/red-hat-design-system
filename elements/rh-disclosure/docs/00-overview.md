## When to use

- Show or hide information with a trigger
- Move extra content away from a task that a user needs to complete
- Organize components that do not fit on small screen sizes like jump links

<div id="overview-image-description" class="visually-hidden">
  An collapsed disclosure element with a gray outline and trigger text that says, "Start your product trial".
</div>
