## When to use

- When you want to have some content you want to expand and collapse
- When putting all of the content on the page might not be relevant to all users
or distract them from the main content on the page

<div id="overview-image-description" class="visually-hidden">
  An expanded disclosure element with a panel trigger and lorem ipsum for details content
</div>
