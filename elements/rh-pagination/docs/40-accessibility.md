## Keyboard interactions

The buttons, page input field, and last page link all have keyboard interactions when the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key is pressed.

| Key                                                | Result                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                                     | Moves focus to the right (not including truncation)     |
| <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>                               | Moves focus to the left (not including truncation)      |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> (when a button has focus)         | Selects a control or changes an inactive page to active |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> (when a new page number is typed) | Navigates users to the page number that is typed        |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> (when last page link has focus)   | Navigates users to the last page                        |

## Focus order

## Touch targets

Buttons, page field input, and the last page link are adequately spaced for optimal touch targets. The default size meets the WCAG [Level AAA success criteria for target size](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size.html) which requires at least a 44px by 44px touch target.

<uxdot-example color-palette="lightest" width-adjustment="792px">
  <img alt="Paginations with elements showing WCAG AAA compliant touch target spacing"
       src="../pagination-a11y-touch-targets-1.svg"
       width="792"
       height="160">
</uxdot-example>

The small size exceeds the WCAG [Level AA success criteria for target size](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html) which calls for touch targets to be at least 24px by 24px, but its buttons do not meet the Level AAA requirement.

## Additional guidelines

- The active page must be conveyed to assistive technologies
- Icon only buttons must have accessible names for assistive technologies
