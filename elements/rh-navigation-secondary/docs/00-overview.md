  ## Anatomy
  ### Introduction to zones

  The secondary navigation is divided into **three zones** where content can be placed. Each zone may include custom content and elements in certain zones will collapse or become hidden completely as breakpoints get smaller. **It is not required to use all three zones.**

  - Zone 1 - Includes **primary elements** that are representative of the experience or series of pages
  - Zone 2 - Includes **navigation elements** like menus and links
  - Zone 3 - Includes **secondary elements** that provide additional actions

  {% alert title="Helpful tip" %}
  Content in Zone 1 should be linked and direct visitors to the main page of the experience when selected.
  {% endalert %}

  ![Secondary navigation - introduction to zones][zones-intro] {style="margin-block:var(--rh-space-2xl, 32px);--inline-img-max-width: 1000px;"}

  ### Zones on small breakpoints
  On small breakpoints, navigation elements in Zone 2 will collapse into an accordion within a menu. Content in Zone 3 will either be positioned below the accordion or be hidden completely.
