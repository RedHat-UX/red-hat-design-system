## Keyboard interactions

All elements within a secondary navigation are focus stops. Pressing <code>Enter</code> when a menu has focus will expand or collapse it. Otherwise, users will be directed to a new page. If the height of the menu is taller than the viewport height due to lots of content, focus is trapped within the panel until the menu is collapsed.
