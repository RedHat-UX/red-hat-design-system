## Usage
Use a statistic to represent a data point that users can consume quickly. 
Statistics help users trust our page content, so use them strategically because 
there is a balance between using some and too many. If a layout has lots of 
content in different arrangements, using a statistic should offer users a visual 
break or respite.

## Footnote
Include a footnote on every page especially if a statistic comes from an 
external source. Doing this increases the credibility of the statistic and 
better integrates the data with the rest of the page content.

{% example 
  palette="light",
  alt="A statistic with a small text footnote underneath",
  src="../stat-footnote.png" %}

## Icons
Use an icon to add visual context and emphasis while helping to explain a 
statistic further.

{% example 
  palette="light",
  alt="Two statistics with icons; the left statistic has a fighter jet icon on top whereas the right has a wrench",
  src="../stat-icon-regular.png" %}

### Large icon
There are situations where a large icon is used in place of data text and the 
data point is written into the body text. This is an edge case, so work with a 
content strategist to write short data text and body text or use another element 
instead.

{% example 
  palette="light",
  alt="Three statistics with large icons and body text",
  src="../stat-icon-large.png" %}

## Writing content
Statistic text is meant to be short so it can have impact especially when 
statistics are grouped together. It is recommended to write as few words as 
possible for text styles.

-   **Title text** - do not allow title text to break to two lines in
    any environment
-   **Data text** - if a percent or number includes a decimal, round up
    to decrease the character count
-   **Body text** - be mindful of using too many words considering how
    statistics look when grouped
-   **Call to action text** - use fewer words to avoid taking away
    impact and focus when reading

### Character and line counts

| Element {style="width: 50%" } | Character count | Line count |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Title text                    | 20              | 1          |
| Data text                     | 7               | 1          |
| Body text                     | 100             | 2          |
| Call to action text           | 30              | 1          |

{.full-width}

### Title text
Title text is used to add quantitative emphasis or help explain data text. 
Include title text if using data text alone does not make sense. In the example 
below, if the data text **40** was by itself, then text title would 
be needed to describe what 40 pertains to or else the statistic would not make 
sense.

{% alert title="Helpful tip", level=4 %}
Title text can be positioned above or below data text even if statistics are 
grouped.
{% endalert %}

{% example 
  palette="light",
  alt="Two statistics, one with title text above the data text and the other with title text below data text",
  src="../stat-text-slot-title.png" %}

### Data text
Data text is the number or percent that represents data.

{% example
  palette="light",
  alt="Two statistics with different data text percents",
  src="../stat-text-slot-data.png" %}

### Body text
Body text explains data text. A percent or number means nothing without 
something that explains the rest of the statistic.

{% example
  palette="light",
  alt="Two statistics with different body text examples",
  src="../stat-text-slot-body.png" %}

### Call to action text
Use a call to action to entice users to learn more after they read a statistic. 
If statistics are grouped, it is not mandatory for each statistic to include a 
call to action.

{% example
  palette="light",
  alt="Statistic with a call to action",
  src="../stat-text-slot-cta.png" %}

### Internationalization
Translated text can increase or decrease character counts, line length, and the 
number of lines. Be mindful when writing body text that might get translated. 
This is important for statistics used in groups as more words will cause them to 
be arranged closer to each other therefore reducing any comfortable spacing 
around them.

{% example
  palette="light",
  alt="Two statistics with English on top and German on the bottom; the English statistic has two lines of body text whereas the German has three",
  src="../stat-i18n-a.png" %}

{% example
    palette="light",
    alt="Two statistics with English on top and Chinese on the bottom; the English statistic body text is wider whereas the Chinese is thinner",
    src="../stat-i18n-b.png" %}

## Layout

### Grouping
The minimum number of statistics per row is one and the maximum is four 
regardless if they are in a container or not.

{% example
    palette="light",
    alt="Four statistics arranged evenly-spaced on a 12-column grid",
    src="../stat-layout-grouping.png" %}

### Card
A statistic can be placed in a card if the body text or other text styles are 
short enough. Otherwise, keep them on the page to avoid readability issues.

{% example
    palette="light",
    alt="Four statistics placed in cards and arranged evenly-spaced on a 12-column grid",
    src="../stat-layout-card.png" %}

### Alignment
By default, a statistic is always center aligned. However, a statistic may be 
left aligned if grouped and if the surrounding content is also left aligned.

{% example
    palette="light",
    alt="Three statistics left aligned with vertical dashed lines on the left side of each",
    src="../stat-layout-alignment.png" %}

### Padding
The page grid usually determines the space between blocks or containers of 
content, but in most situations, it is 32px on large breakpoints. On small 
breakpoints, the padding is 48px for better vertical rhythm.

{% example
    palette="light",
    alt="Two groups of statistics; one group has 32px of padding with text underneath that says ‘Large breakpoints’, the other group has 48px of padding with text underneath that says ‘Small breakpoints’",
    src="../stat-layout-padding.png" %}

## Responsive design

### Large breakpoints
If only one statistic is used, it can span a maximum of six columns.

{% example
    palette="light",
    alt="Statistic spanning less than six columns with a box around the body copy spanning six columns",
    src="../stat-breakpoint-large.png" %}

### Small breakpoints
Statistics arranged in a row on large breakpoints will stack on small
breakpoints. Text sizes will also be reduced based on the [mobile
typography scale](https://ux.redhat.com/foundations/typography/).

{% example
    palette="light",
    alt="Three statistics spanning the width of one column on mobile",
    src="../stat-breakpoint-small.png" %}

## Best practices

### Custom statistic
Do not duplicate or rearrange any element to create a custom statistic.

{% example
    palette="wrong",
    alt="Statistic with some elements arranged horizontally and some vertically which is incorrect usage",
    src="../stat-best-practice-1.png" %}

### Unrelated icon
Do not use an icon that is unrelated to the rest of the statistic content.

{% example
    palette="wrong",
    alt="Statistic with a crab icon on top of text which is incorrect usage",
    src="../stat-best-practice-2.png" %}

### Inconsistent elements
Keep statistics consistent when grouping. Either use the same number of elements 
for all statistics or do not use them at all. For example, if a statistic has an 
icon and the others do not, either remove the icon or ensure they all have an 
icon.

{% example
    palette="wrong",
    alt="Three statistics with different element combinations with is incorrect usage",
    src="../stat-best-practice-3.png" %}

### Too much text
Do not include too much body text, a statistic should clarify a single data 
point quickly and with impact, not tell a long story.

{% example
    palette="wrong",
    alt="Statistic with data text and long lines of body text which is incorrect usage",
    src="../stat-best-practice-4.png" %}
