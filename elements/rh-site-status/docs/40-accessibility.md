## Keyboard navigation

Users should have the ability to move focus to the Website status link if it is used in the Footer component or anywhere else.

{% example palette="none",
  alt="Image of a site status element with a green checkmark and the text 'All systems operational' in a footer element with focus indicators.",
  src="../site-status-accessibility-footer.svg"
%}

## Screen reader guidelines

Website status should communicate the following to users.

- What is the severity of the status icon
- What the text says
- That the text is also a link
- Where the link will take them if selected
