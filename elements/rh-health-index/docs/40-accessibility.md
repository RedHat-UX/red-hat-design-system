## Implementation

Most accessibility concerns should be covered by implementing health index per 
our guidelines. You can double-check your implementation by ensuring the 
following:

- Health index should not be interactive or keyboard-focusable
- Health index should be placed in a context that makes its purpose clear to all 
usersâ€”with and without assistive technologies
- Health index should communicate its grade both visually and to assistive tech

Test your experience with a keyboard and [screen reader][sr] to help verify 
these accessibility conformance checks. `<rh-health-index>` should present to 
assistive technology using the [meter role][meter] and corresponding ARIA 
attributes to communicate to assistive technology. Inspect this element using 
the [DevTools Accessibility Tree][chrome-a11y-dev] to see each value.

## ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)

Learn to use the accessibility semantics defined by the [Accessible Rich
Internet Application][aria] (ARIA) specification to create accessible web 
experiences.
