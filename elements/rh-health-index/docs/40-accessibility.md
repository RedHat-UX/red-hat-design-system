## Implementation

Most accessibility concerns should be covered by implementing health index per our guidelines. You can double-check your implementation by ensuring the following:

- Health index should not be interactive or keyboard-focusable
- Health index should be placed in a context that makes its purpose clear to all usersâ€”with and without assistive technologies
- Health index should communicate its grade both visually and to assistive tech

Test your experience with a keyboard and <a href="/accessibility/qa-testing/#screen-readers">screen reader</a> to help verify these accessibility conformance checks.
