## When to use

- When you need a space-efficient way to present a list of related actions or navigation links
- When you want to organize secondary or contextual options under a single, clearly labeled trigger
- When it’s important to keep the interface clean while still offering access to multiple choices
- When grouping related items improves usability and reduces visual clutter
