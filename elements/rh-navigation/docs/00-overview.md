  ## Anatomy

  The primary navigation is divided into **three zones** where content can be 
  placed. Each zone may include custom content and elements in certain zones 
  will collapse or become hidden completely as breakpoints get smaller. 
  **It is required to use all three zones.**

  - **Zone 1** - Website logo
  - **Zone 2** - Menus
  - **Zone 3** - Utilities

  {% alert title="Helpful tip" %}
  The website logo in Zone 1 should direct visitors to a home page when selected.
  {% endalert %}

  - ### Website logo
    A branded logo corresponding to the website in which the primary navigation 
    is used. It will direct a visitor to the website home page when selected.

    specific to one website and does not appear in the same format on other 
    websites.

    triggered or function as links. They can be unique to one website or global 
    across many websites.
