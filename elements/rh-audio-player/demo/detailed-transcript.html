        <p>
            There are a lot of publicly available data sets out there. But when it 
            comes to specific enterprise use cases, you&apos;re not necessarily going to 
            able to find one to train your models. To realize the power of AI/ML in 
            enterprise environments, end users need an inference engine to run on 
            their hardware. Ryan Loney takes us through OpenVINO and Anomalib, open 
            toolkits from Intel that do precisely that. He looks specifically at 
            anomaly detection in use cases as varied as medical imaging and 
            manufacturing.

            introduces the deep learning library.

            I'm Burr Sutter.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:04">
            I'm a Red Hatter who spends a lot of time talking to technologists about technologies.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:09">
            We say this a lot at Red Hat.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:11">
            No single technology provider holds the key to success, including us.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:15">
            And I would say the same thing about myself.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:18">
            I love to share ideas, so I thought it would be awesome to talk to some brilliant technologists at Red Hat Partners.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:23">
            This is Code Comments, an original podcast from Red Hat.

        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:30">
            I'm sure, like many of you here, you have been thinking about AI/ML, artificial intelligence and machine learning.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:37">
            I've been thinking about that for quite some time and I actually had the opportunity to work on a few successful projects, here at Red Hat, 
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:42">
            spa slot="text">using those technologies, actually enabling a data set,</span>
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:45">
            gathering a data set, working with a data scientist and data engineering team,
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:49">
            and then training a model and putting that model into production runtime environment.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:53">
            It was an exciting set of projects and you can see those on numerous YouTube videos that have published out there before.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:58">
            But I want you to think about the problem space a little bit,
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="00:58">
            because there are some interesting challenges about a AI/ML.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:04">
            One is simply just getting access to the data,
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:05">
            and while there are numerous publicly available data sets,
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:08">
            when it comes to your specific enterprise use case, you might not be to find publicly available data.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:14">
            In many cases you cannot, even for our applications that we created,
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:17">
            we had to create our data set, capture our data set, explore the data set,
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:22">
            and of course, train a model accordingly.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:24">
            And we also found there's another challenge to be overcome in this a AI/ML world,
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:28">
            and that is access to certain types of hardware.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:31">
            If you think about an enterprise environment and the creation of an enterprise application specifically for a AI/ML,
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:36">
            end users need an inference engine to run on their hardware.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:39">
            Hardware that's available to them, to be effective for their application.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:43">
            Let's say an application like Computer Vision, one that can detect anomalies and medical imaging or maybe on a factory floor.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="01:49">
            As those things are whizzing by on the factory line there, looking at them and trying to determine if there is an error or not.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="02:01">
            Well, there's a solution for this as an open toolkit called OpenVINO.
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="02:05">
            And you might be thinking, "Hey, wait a minute, don't you need a GPU for AI inferencing, a GPU for artificial intelligence, machine learning?"
        </rh-audio-player-cue>
        <rh-audio-player-cue start="02:11">
            Well, not according to Ryan Loney, product manager of OpenVINO Developer Tools at Intel.
