  <h3 slot="title">Bringing Deep Learning to Enterprise Applications</h3>
  <rh-audio-player-about slot="about">
    <h4 slot="heading">About the episode</h4>
    <p>
      There are a lot of publicly available data sets out there. But when it
      comes to specific enterprise use cases, you&apos;re not necessarily going
      to able to find one to train your models. To realize the power of AI/ML in
      enterprise environments, end users need an inference engine to run on
      their hardware. Ryan Loney takes us through OpenVINO and Anomalib, open
      toolkits from Intel that do precisely that. He looks specifically at
      anomaly detection in use cases as varied as medical imaging and
      manufacturing.

      introduces the deep learning library.

    <rh-cue start="02:20" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="02:20" end="02:20">I guess we'll</rh-cue>

      >start with trying to maybe dispel the myths, right?</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="02:23" end="02:27"

    <rh-cue start="03:08" end="03:10"

    <rh-cue start="03:10" end="03:13">and why it came out of Intel.</rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="03:12" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="03:12" end="03:16"
      >Definitely. So we had the first release of Open Vino</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:16" end="03:20"
      >was back in 2018, so still relatively new.</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:20" end="03:25"
      >And at that time we were focused on computer vision and pretty tightly
      coupled</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:25" end="03:31"
      >with open CV, which is another open source library with origins at
      Intel.</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:31" end="03:31">You know, it</rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="03:31" end="03:36"
      >had its first release back in 1999, so it's been around a little bit
      longer.</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:36" end="03:40"
      >And many of the software engineers and architects at Intel</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:40" end="03:45"
      >that were involved with and contributing to open CV are working on open
      Vino.</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:45" end="03:49"
      >So you can think of open vino as complementary software to open
      CV.</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:50" end="03:53"
      >And we're providing like an engine for executing inference</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="03:53" end="03:57"
      >as part of a computer vision pipeline, or at least that's how we
      started.</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="03:58" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="03:58" end="04:01"
      >But since 2018, we've we've started to move beyond</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:01" end="04:02">just computer vision inference.</rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="04:02" end="04:05"
      >So when I say computer vision inference, I mean like image</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:05" end="04:08"
      >classification, object detection, segmentation.</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:09" end="04:12"
      >And now we're moving into natural language processing, things</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:12" end="04:16"
      >like speech synthesis, speech recognition, knowledge, graphs,</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:17" end="04:21"
      >time series forecasting, and other use cases that don't involve</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="04:21" end="04:24"

    <rh-cue start="04:25" end="04:28"
      >Our latest release, the 20 22.1 that came out earlier this year,</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:29" end="04:32"
      >there was a most significant update that we've had to open vino</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:32" end="04:36"
      >since we started in 2018, and the major focus of that release</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:36" end="04:40"
      >was optimizing for use cases that go beyond computer vision.</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="04:41" voice="Burr Sutter"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="04:41" end="04:44"

      vision.</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="04:44" end="04:47"

      that.</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="04:47" end="04:50"
      >So could you give us more concrete examples of computer vision?</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="04:50" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>

      you know, if everyone who walked into a grocery store was asked
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="08:44" end="08:49">
      to put a tracking device in their cart or on their person and say, you
      know,

    <rh-cue start="08:50" end="08:53">
      to be tracked around the store, they probably wouldn't want to do that.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="08:53" end="08:56">
      The way that you can do this with cameras is you can,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="08:53" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="08:56" end="09:01">
      you know, detect people as they enter and, you know, remove their face.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:01" end="09:01"> Right. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:01" end="09:05">
      So you can ignore any biometric information
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:05" end="09:08">
      and and just track the person based on pixels
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:09" end="09:12">
      that are present in the detected region of interest.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:12" end="09:15">
      So they're able to analyze, say, a family walks in the door
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:16" end="09:20">
      and they can group those people together with object detection
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:20" end="09:23">
      and then they can track their movement throughout the store
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:23" end="09:26">
      without keeping track of their face or any biometric
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:26" end="09:30">
      or any personal identifiable information to avoid things like bias
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:30" end="09:35">
      and to make sure that they're protecting the privacy of the shoppers in
      the store
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:35" end="09:39">
      while still getting that really useful marketing analytics data rate
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:39" end="09:42">
      so that they can make better decisions about where to place their
      products.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:42" end="09:45">
      So that's one really good example of how
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="09:45" end="09:48">
      computer vision AI with open vino is being used today.

      It is invasive when you hand someone to Bluetooth devices,

      say, please keep this with you as you go throughout our our store

      or our mall or throughout our hospital, wherever you might be.

      Now, you mentioned another example earlier

      in the conversation which was related to like worker safety.

    <rh-cue start="10:05" end="10:08">
      I want to talk more about that concept in a real industrial setting,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:08" end="10:11">
      a manufacturing setting where there might be a factory floor
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:11" end="10:13">
      and there are certain requirements, or better yet, there's like a
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:13" end="10:16">
      a quality assurance requirement, let's say, when it comes to looking
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:16" end="10:20">
      at a factory line, I run to that use case often what some of our
      customers.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:20" end="10:22">
      Can you talk more about those kinds of use cases? Yeah.

    <rh-cue start="10:22" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:22" end="10:27">
      So one of our partners, Robuchon and we you know, published a case study
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:27" end="10:31">
      I think last year where they're working with BMW at one of their factories
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:32" end="10:35">
      and they do quality control inspection, but they're also doing
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:35" end="10:38">
      things related to worker safety and analyzing.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:38" end="10:40">
      You know, I used the safety had example.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:40" end="10:45">
      There's a number of of our ISP's and partners who have similar use cases.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:45" end="10:48">
      And it comes down to there's a few reasons
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:48" end="10:51">
      that are motivating this and some are related to like insurance, right?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:51" end="10:53">
      It's important to make sure that
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:53" end="10:56">
      if you want to have your factory insured and that your workers
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:56" end="10:58">
      are protecting themselves and wearing the gear.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="10:58" end="11:00"> Regulatory compliance. Right. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="11:00" end="11:05">
      You're you're being asked to properly protect from exposure to chemicals
      or,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="11:05" end="11:09">
      you know, potentially having something fall and and hit someone on the
      head.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="11:09" end="11:13">
      So wearing a safety vest, wearing goggles, wearing a helmet,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="11:14" end="11:17">
      these are things that you need to do inside the factory.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="11:17" end="11:21">
      And you can really easily automate and detect and sometimes without bias.

    <rh-cue start="11:21" end="11:26">
      I think that's one of the interesting things about the robots on BMW
      example
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="11:26" end="11:31">
      is that they were also blurring sort of blocking out and so drawing a box

      to cover the face of the workers in the factory
    </rh-cue>

      so that somebody who was analyzing the video footage
    </rh-cue>

      and getting the alerts saying that, hey, you know, Bay 21 has a worker

      without a hat on, that it's not sending their face

      and in the alert and potentially, you know, invading
    </rh-cue>

      or going against privacy laws or just the ethics of the company.

    <rh-cue start="11:54" end="11:58">
      They don't want to introduce bias or have people targeted because
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="11:58" end="12:02">
      it's much better to to have it be, you know, blur the face

      and alert and have somebody take care of it on the floor.

      And then if you ever need to audit that information later,

      who the employee was and look up their personal information, they can do

      especially in a digital world that we now live in.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:02" end="13:05">
      But for now, let's move on and explore different area.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:05" end="13:08">
      I'm interested in how machines and computers offer advantages,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:08" end="13:12">
      specifically in certain use cases like a quality control scenario.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:12" end="13:15">
      I asked Ryan to explain how AML and specifically machines
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:15" end="13:18">
      computers can augment that capability.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:19" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:19" end="13:22">
      I can give a specific example where we have a partner
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:22" end="13:25">
      that's there doing defect detection with
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:25" end="13:28">
      and looking for anomalies in batteries.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:28" end="13:31">
      So, you know, sure, you've heard there's a lot of interest right now
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:31" end="13:34">
      in electric vehicles, a lot of batteries being produced.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:34" end="13:36">
      And so if you go into one of these factories,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:36" end="13:40">
      they have images that they collect of every battery that's going through
      this
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:40" end="13:44">
      assembly line and through these images, people
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:44" end="13:47">
      can look and see and visually inspect with their eyes and say,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:48" end="13:50">
      this battery has a defect, send it back.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:50" end="13:53">
      And that's one step in the quality control process.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:53" end="13:58">
      And there's other steps, I'm sure, like running diagnostic tests and, you
      know,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="13:58" end="14:02">
      measuring voltage and doing other types of non-visual inspection.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:02" end="14:06">
      But for the visual inspection piece where you can really easily identify
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:06" end="14:10">
      some problems, it's much more efficient to introduce computer vision.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:11" end="14:14">
      And so that's where we have this new library that we've introduced
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:14" end="14:17">
      called Anomali, that's open vino.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:17" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:17" end="14:20">
      While we're focused on inference, you know, we're also thinking
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:20" end="14:25">
      about the pipeline or the funnel that gets these models to open vino.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:25" end="14:28">
      And so we've we've invested in this anomaly segmentation,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:28" end="14:32">
      anomaly detection library and that we've recently open source
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:32" end="14:35">
      and there's a great research paper about it about Anomali.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:36" end="14:39">
      But the idea is you can take just a few images
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:39" end="14:43">
      and train a model and start detecting these defects.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:43" end="14:46">
      And so for this battery example, that's a more advanced example.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:46" end="14:52">
      But to make it simpler, you know, take some bolts and, you know, take ten
      bolts.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:52" end="14:55">
      You have one that has a scratch on it or one that is chipped
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:56" end="14:58"> or has some damage to it. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="14:58" end="15:00">
      And you can easily get started in training
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:00" end="15:03">
      to recognize the bolts that do not have an anomaly.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:04" end="15:06">
      And the ones that do, which is a small data set
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:06" end="15:10">
      and I think that's really one of the most important things today.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:11" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:11" end="15:14">
      Challenges is one is access to data, but the other is
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:14" end="15:17">
      is needing a massive amount of data to do something meaningful.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:18" end="15:22">
      And so we're starting to try to change that dynamic with Anomali.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:22" end="15:27">
      So you may not need 100,000 images, you may need 100 images,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:27" end="15:33">
      and you can start detecting anomalies in everything from batteries to
      bolts to,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:33" end="15:37">
      you know, maybe even the wood varnish use case that you mentioned.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:37" voice="Burr Sutter"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:37" end="15:40">
      That is very key point because often in that data scientist
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:40" end="15:43">
      process, that data engineer and data scientist process, right.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:43" end="15:44">
      The one key thing is can you gather
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:44" end="15:47">
      the data that you need for the input for the model training?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:47" end="15:49">
      And we've often sat at least people I've worked
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:49" end="15:52">
      with over the last couple of years, you know, you need a lot of data.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:52" end="15:55">
      You need tens of thousands of correct images
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:55" end="15:58">
      so we can sort out the difference between dogs versus cats, let's say,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="15:58" end="16:01">
      or you need dozens and dozens of situations
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:01" end="16:03">
      where if it's a natural language processing scenario,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:03" end="16:06">
      you know, a good customer interaction, a good customer conversation,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:06" end="16:07"> and in this case, </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:07" end="16:11">
      it sounds like what you're saying is show us just the bad things, right?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:11" end="16:14">
      Fewer images, fewer incorrect things,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:14" end="16:17">
      and then let us look for those kind of anomalies.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:18" end="16:20">
      Can tell us more about that because that is very interesting.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:20" end="16:23">
      The concept that I can use a much smaller dataset as my input
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:23" end="16:26">
      as opposed to gathering terabytes of data in some cases
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:26" end="16:29">
      to just simply get my model training underway.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:30" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:30" end="16:34">
      You know, like you described, the idea is if you have some good images
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:34" end="16:37">
      and then you have some of the the known defects
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:38" end="16:41">
      and you can just label here's a set of good images
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:41" end="16:44">
      and here's a few of the defects and you can right away
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:44" end="16:48">
      start detecting those specific defects that you've identified.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:48" end="16:49">
      And then also, you know, be able to
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:50" end="16:53"> determine when it doesn't match </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:53" end="16:57">
      the expected appearance of a non defective item.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="16:57" end="17:00">
      So if I have the undamaged screw and then I introduce
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:00" end="17:03">
      one with some new anomaly that's never been seen before,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:04" end="17:07">
      I can say, you know, this one is not a valid screw.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:07" end="17:11">
      And so that's sort of the the approach that we're taking.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:11" end="17:15">
      And it's really important because so often you need to have
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:15" end="17:19">
      subject matter experts often like if you think the take the battery
      example,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:20" end="17:23">
      there's these workers who are on the floor
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:23" end="17:27">
      in a factory and they're the ones who know best when they look at these
      images,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:28" end="17:31">
      which one's going to have an issue, which one's defective?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:31" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:31" end="17:34">
      And then they also need to take that subject matter, expertise
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:35" end="17:38">
      and then use it to annotate data sets.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:38" end="17:39">
      And when you have these, you know,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:39" end="17:43">
      tens of thousands of images you need to annotate, it's asking those people
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:43" end="17:47">
      to stop working on the factory floor so they can come annotate some
      images.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:47" end="17:49">
      That's a tough business call to make, right?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:49" end="17:53">
      But if you only need them to annotate a handful of images, it's a much
      easier
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:53" end="17:56">
      ask to get the ball rolling and demonstrate value.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:56" end="17:59">
      And maybe over time you will want to annotate more
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="17:59" end="18:03">
      and more images because you'll get even better accuracy in the model.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:03" end="18:07">
      Even better, even if it's just small incremental improvements.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:08" end="18:11">
      You know, that's something that if it generates value for the business,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:11" end="18:14">
      it's something the business will invest in over time.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:14" end="18:17">
      But you have to convince the decision makers that it's worth
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:17" end="18:22">
      the time of these subject matter experts to stop what they're doing
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:22" end="18:26">
      and go and label some images of the things that they're working on in the
      factory.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:26" voice="Burr Sutter"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:26" end="18:30">
      And that labeling process can be very labor intensive of the annotations,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:30" end="18:33">
      basically saying what is correct, what's wrong, what is this, what is
      that?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:33" end="18:36">
      And therefore, if we can minimize that time frame to get the value
      quicker,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:36" end="18:40">
      then there's something that's useful for the business, useful for the

      long before we necessarily good.

    <rh-cue start="18:49" voice="Burr Sutter"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:49" end="18:52">
      so we talk about labeling and how that is labor intensive activity.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:52" end="18:54">
      But I love the idea of helping the human
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:54" end="18:57">
      and helping the human models specifically not get bored.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="18:57" end="19:01">
      Basically, if the human is eyeballing a bunch of widgets flying by over
      time,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="19:01" end="19:03">
      they make mistakes, they get bored
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="19:03" end="19:06">
      and they don't pay as close attention as they should.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="19:07" end="19:10">
      That's why the concept of Amazon specifically computer vision, augmenting
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="19:10" end="19:14">
      that capability and really helping the human identify anomalies faster,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="19:14" end="19:17">
      more quickly, maybe with greater accuracy could be a big win.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="19:18" end="19:21">
      We focused on manufacturing, but let's actually go into health care
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="19:21" end="19:24">
      and learn how these tools can be used in that sector and that industry.

      Ryan talked to me about how Open Windows runtime can be incorporated into

      imaging equipment with intel processors and better than c.T.

      to help with nurses and doctors who were intubating patients
    </rh-cue>

      breathing tubes gets placed incorrectly

      when you're doing it outside the operating room,
    </rh-cue>

      because when you're in an operating room, it's much more controlled
    </rh-cue>

      and there's someone who's an expert at placing the tubes.

      It's something you have more of a controlled environment

      than when you're out in a parking lot, in a tent.

      You know, when the hospital's completely full and you're triaging patients
    </rh-cue>

      with COVID, that's when they're more likely to make mistakes.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="20:37" end="20:40">
      And so they had this endotracheal tube placement

    <rh-cue start="20:43" end="20:47">
      and it helped to use an x ray and give an alert and say, hey,

    <rh-cue start="20:47" end="20:50">
      this tube is placed wrong, pull it out and do it again.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="20:50" end="20:53">
      And so things like that help doctors so that they can avoid mistakes.

      And, you know, having a breathing tube placed incorrectly
    </rh-cue>

      can cause collapsed lung and a number of other unwanted side effects.

    <rh-cue start="22:15" voice="Burr Sutter"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:15" end="22:18">
      and so there's always a percentage outcome, you know?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:18" end="22:21">
      In other words, I think it's a dog 52%.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:21" end="22:22">
      So I want to talk about that more.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:22" end="22:25">
      What how important is it to get to 100% accuracy?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:25" end="22:29">
      How important is it to really, depending on the use case, to allow
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:29" end="22:34">
      for the gray area, if you will, where it's an 80% accuracy or 70%
      accuracy?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:34" end="22:36">
      And where are the trade offs there associated with the application?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:36" end="22:38">
      Can you can you discuss that more?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:38" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:38" end="22:40">
      Accuracy is definitely, you know, a touchy subject
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:40" end="22:43">
      because how you measure it makes a huge difference.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:43" end="22:46">
      And then I think with like what you were describing with the dog example,
      there's
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:46" end="22:51">
      sort of a top five potential classes that might may be identified.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:51" end="22:55">
      So let's say you're doing object detection and you detect a region of
      interest
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:55" end="22:57"> and it says 65% confidence. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:57" end="22:58"> This is a dog. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="22:58" end="23:03">
      Well, the next potential label that could be maybe 50% confidence
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:03" end="23:08">
      or 20% confidence might be something similar to a dog or in the case of
      models
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:08" end="23:11">
      that have been trained on like the image net dataset
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:11" end="23:15">
      or on cocoa data set, they have like actual breeds of dogs.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:15" end="23:20">
      So if I want to look at the top five labels for a dog,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:20" end="23:24">
      for my dog, for example, she's a mixed mostly Labrador retriever.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:24" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:24" end="23:29">
      But I may look at the top five labels and it may say 65% confidence that
      she's
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:29" end="23:34">
      a flat coated retriever and then confidence that she's a husky,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:34" end="23:39">
      as you know, 20% and then 5% confidence that she's a greyhound or
      something.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:40" end="23:42">
      Those labels, all of them are dogs.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:42" end="23:45">
      So if I'm just trying to figure out is, is this a dog,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:45" end="23:50">
      I could probably find all of the, you know, classes within the data set
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:50" end="23:53">
      and say, well, these are all, you know, class ID
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="23:53" end="24:00">
      65, 132, 92 and 158 all belong to a group of dogs.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:00" end="24:04">
      So if I wanted to just write an application to tell me if this is a dog
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:04" end="24:07">
      or not, I would probably use that to determine if it's a dog.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:08" end="24:10">
      But how you measure that is accuracy.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:10" end="24:11">
      Well, that's where it gets a little bit complicated,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:11" end="24:15">
      because if you're being really strict about the definition and you're
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:15" end="24:18">
      trying to validate against the data set of labeled images
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:18" end="24:22">
      and I have specific dog breeds or some specific detail
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:22" end="24:25">
      and it doesn't match, well, then the accuracy is going to go down.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:25" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:25" end="24:29">
      That's especially important when we talk about things like compression
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:29" end="24:30"> and quantization, </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:30" end="24:34">
      which, you know, historically has been difficult for to get adoption
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:34" end="24:40">
      in some domains like health care, where even the hint of accuracy going
      down
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:40" end="24:44">
      implies that we're not going to be able to help in some small case,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:44" end="24:47">
      maybe if it's even half a percent of the time
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:47" end="24:51">
      we want to take that that tube is placed incorrectly or that, you know,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:51" end="24:54">
      that patient's, you know, lung has collapsed or something like that.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:54" end="24:58">
      And that's something that really prevents adoption of some of these
      methods
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="24:58" end="25:01">
      that can really boost performance like quantization.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:01" end="25:05">
      But if you take that example of sort of different from the dog example
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:05" end="25:07">
      and you think about like segmentation of kidneys.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:07" end="25:11">
      So if I'm doing kidney segmentation, which is, you know, taking a CT scan
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:12" end="25:14">
      and then trying to pick the pixels out of that
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:14" end="25:17"> scan that belong to a kidney, </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:17" end="25:20"> how I measure accuracy may be </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:20" end="25:24">
      how many of those pixels I'm able to detect and how many did I miss?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:25" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:25" end="25:29">
      Missing some of the pixels is maybe not a problem, right,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:29" end="25:33">
      depending on how you built the application because you still detect the
      kidney
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:34" end="25:38">
      and maybe you just need to apply padding around the region of interest
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:38" end="25:41">
      so that you don't miss any of the the actual kidney.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:42" end="25:45">
      When you compress the model and when you quantized the model. But
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:45" end="25:50">
      that requires, you know, data scientist and email engineer somebody to
      really
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:51" end="25:52"> they have to be </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:52" end="25:55">
      able to go and apply that after the fact, after the inference
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:55" end="25:59">
      happens to make sure that you're not losing critical information,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="25:59" end="26:02">
      because the next step from detecting the kidney may be detecting a tumor.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:03" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:03" end="26:06">
      And so maybe you can use the more optimized model
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:06" end="26:11">
      to detect the kidney, but then you can use a slower model to detect the
      tumor.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:11" end="26:15">
      But that also requires somebody to architect and make that decision
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:15" end="26:16"> or that tradeoff and say, </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:16" end="26:20">
      well, I need to add padding, or I should only use the quantized model
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:20" end="26:24">
      to detect the region of interest for the kidney and then use the model
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:24" end="26:27">
      that takes longer to do the inference
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:27" end="26:30">
      just to find the tumor, which is going to be on a smaller size.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:30" end="26:33">
      Right. The dimensions are going to be much smaller
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:33" end="26:35">
      once we crop to the region of interest.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:35" end="26:40">
      But all of those details, that's maybe not easy to explain in a few
      sentences.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:40" end="26:43">
      And even the way I explained it is probably really confusing.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:45" voice="Burr Sutter"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:45" end="26:46"> I do love that use case. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:46" end="26:47">
      Like you mentioned, the cropping
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:47" end="26:50">
      even in one such an area that we worked on for another project,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:50" end="26:53">
      we specifically decided to pix like the image that we had taken
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:53" end="26:57">
      because we knew that we could get the outcome we wanted by even
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="26:57" end="27:01">
      just using a smaller or less having less resolution in our image.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:01" end="27:04">
      And therefore, as we transferred it from the mobile device storage device
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:04" end="27:08">
      up into the cloud, we wanted that smaller image just for transfer purposes
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:08" end="27:11">
      and it still we could get the accuracy we needed by a lot of testing.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:11" voice="Burr Sutter"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:11" end="27:14">
      And one thing that's interesting about that from my perspective is
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:15" end="27:18">
      if you're doing image processing, sometimes it takes a while
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:18" end="27:20"> for this transaction to occur. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:20" end="27:20"> Like I, </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:20" end="27:24">
      I come from a traditional application background, you know, where I'm
      reading
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:24" end="27:25">
      and writing things from a database
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:25" end="27:28">
      or a message broker or moving data from one place to another.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:28" end="27:29"> Those things happen subsequent. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:29" end="27:33">
      Normally, even with great latency between your data centers, you know,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:33" end="27:34"> it's still subsequent. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:34" end="27:38">
      In most cases, while on a transaction like this, one can actually take 2
      seconds
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:38" end="27:42">
      or 4 seconds as it's doing its analysis and actually coming back with, you
      know,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:42" end="27:46">
      I think it's a dog, I think it's a kidney, I think it's whatever, and
      provided me
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:46" end="27:48"> that accuracy statement. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:48" end="27:51">
      So that concept of optimization is very important
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:51" end="27:53">
      in the overall application architecture.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:53" end="27:56">
      Would you agree with that or how do you think about that concept?
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:56" end="27:56"> Yeah, definitely. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:56" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:56" end="27:58"> It depends too on the use case. </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="27:58" end="28:02">
      So if you think about how important it is to reduce the latency
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="28:02" end="28:06">
      and increase the number of frames per second that you can process when
      you're

      talking about a loss prevention model that's running at a grocery store.
    </rh-cue>

    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="28:13" end="28:16">
      You don't want every person who's at the self-checkout

      to have to wait 5 seconds for every item they scan.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="28:19" end="28:22">
      You need it to happen as quickly as possible.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="28:22" end="28:25">
      And if sometimes you, you know, the accuracy
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="28:25" end="28:28">
      decreases slightly or the I'd say the accuracy of the whole pipeline.
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="28:28" end="28:32">
      So not just looking at the individual model or the individual inference,
      but
    </rh-cue>

      let's say that the the whole pipeline is not as successful at detecting
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="28:37" end="28:40">
      when somebody steals one item from the self-checkout,
    </rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="28:41" end="28:43">
      it's not going to be a life threatening situation.

      They don't need it to happen in 500 milliseconds.

      So that, I think, also drives some of the decision, like

    <rh-cue start="30:10" end="30:14"
      >and the people who are deploying on Intel hardware, they're trying to
      run</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="30:14" end="30:16">more complicated models.</rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="30:16" end="30:19"
      >They're the models that are doing object detection or, you know,</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="30:19" end="30:22"

      do face</rh-cue

      >detection or person detection or vehicle detection and license plate
      detection.</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="30:32" end="30:33">And those are sort of like</rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="30:33" end="30:36"
      >general purpose models that you can just grab off the shelf and use
      them.</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="30:37" end="30:40"
      >But now we're moving into like the anomaly scenarios</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="30:40" end="30:44"
      >where I've got my own data and I'm trying to do something very
      specific</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="30:57" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>
    <rh-cue start="30:57" end="31:02"
      >And so those use cases, the challenge with with training those
      models</rh-cue
    >
    <rh-cue start="31:02" end="31:06"
      >and and getting them optimized is the beginning of the pipeline.</rh-cue

    <rh-cue start="31:06" end="31:10"

    <rh-cue start="31:10" end="31:12"

    <rh-cue start="31:16" end="31:17"

    <rh-cue start="31:29" end="31:34"

    <rh-cue start="31:50" voice="Ryan Loney"></rh-cue>

    <rh-cue start="31:54" end="31:59"
