## Features 
Three features are included and are accessible within the contextual menu.

## Contextual menu 
Pressing the `More options` button opens the contextual menu. The description and title are visible in the Full player but not in the Compact player, so there is an extra option in the contextual menu so users can access that information.

## Content panel 
When a feature is selected, the audio player expands and reveals the content panel. In the Full player, some interface elements get smaller, rearrange, or become hidden. In the Compact and Mini players, the content panel is below the controls. The `More options` button changes to a `Close` button as well which allows users to close the panel and return to the audio player at any time.

## Audio info 
Displays the description and title in the Compact player only.

A transcript is an accessible alternative for users who are hard of hearing, deaf, or just want to read along.

### Highlighting 
When audio is playing, the transcript scrolls automatically and words are highlighted as they are spoken. Users also have the option to scroll on their own or download the entire transcript.
