## Labeling icons

If an icon is interactive or otherwise not merely decorative, it will need to be labeled using <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code>.

<!-- Add example and code block-->

## Hiding icons

If an icon is presentational and its meaning is already expressed with accessible copy elsewhere, it should be removed from the accessibility tree using <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> or <code>role="presentation"</code>.
