      In such a case, all of the grid card's footers should be
      vertically aligned. Meaning, they should always rest in
      the bottom of their card. Even when one card has much more
      content than its neighbour, and thus fill more vertical space
      in it's body, the footers should still be aligned.

      These kinds of situations should best be avoided. See the
