/**
 * A progress stepper conveys the steps necessary to complete a process or task, and the status of
 * each step. Steps have titles and descriptions; and each step can be in one of a number of possible states:
 * - inactive (yet to be performed)
 * - active (currently being performed)
 * - warn (succeeded, but with warnings)
 * - fail (failed to occur)
 * Or a custom state, set using the `icon` attribute.
 *
 * ## Usage guidelines
 * - Use 3-5 steps maximum to reduce cognitive load
 * - Designed to complement standard previous/next navigation. Avoid using as the only navigation.
 * - When process is completed, users cannot go back and must start over
 *
 * ## Accessibility
 * - Communicates list structure and step states to screen readers
 * - Supports keyboard navigation for linked step titles
 * - Maintains logical focus order (left to right, top to bottom)
 * - Provides aria-current for the active step
 *
 * @summary Communicate how many steps are required to complete a process
