## When to use

- When you need to better organize a content structure
- When you need to provide a more granular navigation that is specific to a 
  topic
- When you need to prevent other navigations from getting overloaded

<div id="overview-image-description" class="visually-hidden">
  Image of two stacked secondary navigations; one for large breakpoints and the 
  other for small breakpoints
</div>
