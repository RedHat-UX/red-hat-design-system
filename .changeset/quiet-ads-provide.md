âœ¨ Added `<rh-icon>`.

  Icons represents general concepts and can support text as a decorative element. The `<rh-icon>` element allows experience and content authors to add Red Hat icons of varying dimensions in the same area without shifting surrounding content.

```html
<rh-icon icon="alert"></rh-icon>
```

`<rh-icon>` has experimental SSR support. It's not ready for production, but if you try it, let us know!
