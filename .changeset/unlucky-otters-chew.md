`rh-tooltip` is being moved from the previous version of `pfe-tooltip` to the newest version which includes the migration from popperjs to floating-ui.

This will provide user experience and performance improvements and eliminate the need for the `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable to be set by the user going forward.
