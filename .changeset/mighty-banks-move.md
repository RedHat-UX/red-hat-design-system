âœ¨ Added `<rh-navigation-drawer>`

Navigation drawer is a vertical panel that provides a slottable area for navigation content. It is one part of the composable vertical navigation pattern, allowing users to access navigation items in a space-efficient way, collapsing to a disclosure pattern on narrow screens.

 ```html 
  <rh-navigation-drawer>
    <div slot="header">
      Header (optional)
    </div>
    Drawer content
    <div slot="footer">
      Footer (optional)
    </div>
  </rh-navigation-drawer>
```
